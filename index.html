            The ocean covers almost three-quarters of the Earth's surface. It is the world's largest and most powerful producer of oxygen.
        </p>
        <p>
           One of the most biodiverse ecosystem is California Kelp Ecosystem. Numerous species of fish, birds, mammals, and invertebrates call the kelp forest their home. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Between 2014 and now, the California Kelp Ecosystem has been reduced by more than 95%.
        </p>
        <p>
            We have chosen to highlight three organizations that are working to educate, explore, and preserve the kelp ecosystem.
