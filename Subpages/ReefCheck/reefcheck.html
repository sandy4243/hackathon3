        <p id="kelp_text"> Along the West Coast of North America, Reef Check helps ensure the long-term sustainability and health of the nearshore rocky reefs and kelp forests. 
            Reef Check volunteer citizen scientists are divers, fishermen, kayakers, surfers, boaters, and a wide range of people who take a proactive role in making 
            sure that our nearshore ecosystems are healthy and well managed. Reef Check trains scuba divers to be citizen scientists familiar with local marine life and how to survey kelp forests. 
            Reef Check provides them with the skills to conduct scientific surveys and then lead them in monitoring kelp forests along the West Coast of North America. Visit the  <a href="https://www.reefcheck.org/california-program/">Kelp Forest Program</a> page to learn more!

        Reef Check's training program is an opportunity for divers to learn how to become a citizen scientist and how to use their skills to help protect the reefs and kelp forests. 
        This training is conduced over four weeks of lecture, then two field weekends to hone diver's data collection skills. The training places a large emphasis on making sure the 
        data being collected is accurate and reliable, as it is relied upon by scientists and government officials to influce policy and research. Check out their <a href="https://www.reefcheck.org/california-program/training-schedule/">Diver Training</a> page for more information
